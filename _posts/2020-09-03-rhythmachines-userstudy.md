title: Rhythmachines, a 3D Sequencer in Sema
date: 2020-09-03

Rhythmachines is a 3D sequencer within the [sema](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema 'sema') environment. Made as part of a research project at the University of Sussex to evaluate how 3-dimensional sequencing effects composition. This allows for a novel sequencing interface within a playground where you can rapidly prototype live coding mini-languages for signal synthesis, machine learning and machine listening.

In our environment, sequences are made through a combination of cylinders and pegs. Similar in principle to a mechanical music box. The key difference being that with a music box sound is usually produced through the flicking of a metal comb. With our sequencer sound is produced when pegs interact or rather "collide", with other pegs.

Please see this [demonstration](https://youtu.be/n6PXqLJToTs 'demonstration') where you can see what this looks like in practice.

This week we are running a user study in order to evaluate the software and if this all seems intriguing to you please sign up here. particularly, we are looking for musicians programmers or anyone with an interest. Written and video tutorials are provided for different aspects of the system, so please sign up and get involved.
