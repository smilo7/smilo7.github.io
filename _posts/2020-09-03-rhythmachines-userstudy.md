__Rhythmachines__ is a 3D sequencer within the [sema](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema 'sema') environment. Made as part of a research project at the University of Sussex to evaluate how 3-dimensional sequencing effects composition.

The result is a novel sequencing interface within the sema playground, where you can rapidly prototype live coding mini-languages for signal synthesis, machine learning and machine listening.

In our sequencer environment, sequences are made through a combination of 'cylinders' and 'pegs'. This is similar in principle to a mechanical music box. In a music box, sound is usually produced by a peg (sometimes referred to as a pin) flicking a metal comb. Since our sequencer is not constrained by the physical world, sound is produced when two pegs interact or rather "collide" together. This allows for an increased level of complexity and some interesting dynamics to play with.

Please see this [demonstration](https://youtu.be/n6PXqLJToTs 'demonstration') where you can see what this looks like in practice.

or check out the software for yourself at [rhythmachines url](amalgah.github.io).

__This week__ we are running a user study in order to evaluate the software. If any of this sounds intriguing to you please sign up here. More infomation will be sent out to those who sign up.

We are particularly looking for musicians, programmers, artists or anyone with an interest in experimenting with new tools for musical expression.

 Written and video tutorials are provided for different aspects of the system, so please sign up and hopefully enjoy using the sequencer!
