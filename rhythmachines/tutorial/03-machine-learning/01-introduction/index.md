# Introduction: The JavaScript Window

Machine learning is managed in the *JavaScript* Editor in Sema.   

In this window, you can use a selection of machine learning libraries to train and run machine learning models. All our machine learning libraries are JavaScript, the language of the web. 

You can create processes within this window that are run automatically, and are invisible to the live coder, so that they can use machine learning (ML) transparently. It can send and receive data to and from the live coding window.  

Follow the instructions in the ML window to learn the basic operations.

In this tutorial, you will need to open the JavaScript console* to look at logging data.  You can do this in Chrome by opening the 'Developer Tools' (F12 key) and choosing the console tab (or use key combination cmd+alt+j).

*a console is where you can get feedback from the interpreter running your program, such as errors or post messages)
