## Getting Started with Sema!

Welcome to the Sema tutorial! In this tutorial you will learn everything you need to know to start live coding music and audio with machine learning and designing your own live coding language. 

You can also consult the [API docs](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/tree/master/docs) for further information. If you're impatient to start hacking Sema free-style, use the playground or explore the source code on Github. You will find links for that in the top banner of this page.

When you have explored this tutorial and want to start to make your music, you will exit this *Tutorial* and do all your work in the *Playground*.

### What is Sema?

Sema is a live coding environment for performing and composing music in realtime using simple live coding languages. 

It is also a playground for designing and training machine learning networks and creating your own languages.

It is similar to other live coding environments and domain-specific languages for sound and music, such as SuperCollider, TidalCycles and Gibber.

Uniquely, Sema provides an integrated experience to machine learning and language design in your Web browser. It has a real-time, interactive interpreter for machine learning libraries (e.g. [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/)) and a compiler for [BNF grammars](http://hardmath123.github.io/earley.html) working in the browser in real-time.

### How to use this tutorial

This tutorial aims to provide a lightweight introduction and a gradual learning experience for you to get going with Sema. 

We recommended that you go from start to finish. You can navigate the Table of Contents via the dropdown menu above (click 'Introduction').

* Part 1, *Basics* starts with the basics of the playground interface, including layouts, the live coding editors and all the available widgets.  

* Part 2, *Live Coding with the default language* will get you started with the basic element and syntax of Sema's default language.

* Part 3, *Machine Learning* will show you some machine learning wizardry with custom neural networks architecture. 

* Part 4 *Language Design* will introduce you to the concepts and workflow to help you get started designing your own custom language. 

As you progress through the tutorial, you'll be presented with code and comments designed to illustrate how to use Sema's features. 

You can copy and paste code in the editors and tweak it to explore the possibilities. 
We recommend that you type it all in manually, the <em>live coding</em> way. 

And most importantly, have fun!!!
