# Editors 

Code editors are the most important widgets in Sema. There are three main types available in Sema:

* *LiveCode Editor*

* *Model Editor* 

* *Grammar Editor* 


Currently, Sema supports only one instance of each editor type, which you will use to live code with different languages.   

All editors provide functions such as "Search" (**cmd-F**/**ctrl-F**) and "Replace" (**shift-ctrl-F**/**cmd-option-F**) and syntax highlighting. 

You can think of each of these editors as specialised in a certain scope and functionality, each with its own notation. Each editor also has specific commands as you will see next.


## LiveCode Editor

The LiveCode Editor (black background) is where you will live code your music with a specific language syntax. 

The LiveCode Editor also gives you commands through key combinations:

* to evaluate the code and playback sound, use **cmd–Enter** (Mac) OR **ctrl–Enter** (Win/Linux) [*command+Enter*]

* to pause playback and stop sound, use **cmd–.** (Mac) OR **ctrl–.** (Win/Linux) [*command+period*]

* to comment out lines of code in the editor, use **cmd–/** (Mac) OR **ctrl–/** (Win/Linux) [*command+forwardslash*]


## Model Editor

In the *Model Editor* (white background), you can use JavaScript to edit and create new machine learning models.

Part 3 of this tutorial provides a more detailed walkthrough on how to use this editor to work with your neural networks and communicate with the LiveCode Editor.


## Grammar Editor

The *Grammar Editor* (grey backgroud) enables you to customize and create a new language by defining and editing grammars. 

This editor is *context-dependent* and bound to the language of the LiveCode editor. So give focus to you LiveCode editor to show the button to create the grammar Editor.

Grammar editing and language design will be explained in more detail in Part 4 of this tutorial.
